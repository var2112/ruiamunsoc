          The fundamental tenets of all democracies and societies under the rule
          of law are human rights. The fundamental significance of human rights
          has been widely accepted since the end of World War II. It is even
          more crucial today, in light of the numerous conflicts, humanitarian
          crises, and serious transgressions of international law, that policy
          responses be firmly rooted in human rights and that states uphold the
          legally binding obligations they entered into when ratifying
          international human rights treaties. International human rights
          legislation offers a crucial foundation and direction for responsible
          and sustainable policy-making in a variety of areas, including the
          battle against violent extremism, the effort to eradicate poverty, and
          our method of managing migration.

          Parliamentarians are closely connected to the issues of the populace.
          Parliaments may advance the fundamental principles of respect,
          communication, and compromise at a time when our society is becoming
          more polarised. Discriminatory and xenophobic discourse has no place
          in society since it damages societies and causes communities to become
          more polarised. Parliaments that create effective laws, accurately
          reflect the variety of their societies, and hold their administrations
          accountable have the capacity to significantly influence the direction
          of their nations' futures. It is not impossible to recognise that
          members of particular groups may require more protection while
          adhering to the ideals of equality, universality, and
          non-discrimination. Specific human rights instruments and processes
          have been created in order to defend the rights of women as well as
          certain groups, including detainees, migrant workers, stateless
          people, refugees, displaced people, minorities, indigenous peoples,
          children, and people with disabilities.

          Throughout the years, we have fought for civil liberties, and we are
          aware that occasionally the light gets a little dimmer, which puts
          democracy in jeopardy. Now, civil liberties have been lost in many
          other nations, partly as a result of the unrest in the rest of the
          world. Of course, maintaining freedom of the press, freedom of
          expression, and freedom of assembly while at war is difficult. They
          instantly vanish. Therefore, they have left numerous nations where
          they were formerly secure. In other nations, not only did freedom of
          the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappear before
          the start of the conflict, but also freedom of religion. We are aware
          of the serious obligation we bear as citizens of this nation. We live
          in harmony. We must protect democratic liberties because we have no
          justification for the anxieties that dominate so many other people
          throughout the world.
