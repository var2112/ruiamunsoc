          <p>
            It is with great pride that we let you know that it is going to be
            our first ever event since the inception of our team. With
            committees ranging from the Lok Sabha to International Press,
            RUIAMUN'22 will put forth a wide range of significant matters that
            are real-life threats to our existence and how the real entities of
            our simulation would address them. The theme for the RUIAMUN'22 is
            Preservation of Democracy, Equality, and Civil Liberties.
            Undeniably, It is true that real democracy is currently beneath the
            covers by virtue of loopholes in our system of understanding and
            eventually governance. It is important for young minds; the future
            of tomorrow to understand that this is not how a society should
            operate. The mere essence of our constitution should always shine.
            Democracy is not a new concept to India & to most of the world.
            India along with the entire world has a long tradition of tolerance
            of different views and creeds, which is the hallmark of any true
            democracy. There is also considerable evidence of the widespread
            existence of democratic institutions in ancient times. In the Vedic
            period, the republics were called Gana-Rajya. These Gana-Rajyas were
            autonomous and were governed by an elected Gana-Mukhya. The ancient
            Greek City States were and are a symbol of what transparent
            Governance is. Decisions were taken by voting on important issues. A
            democratic form of government is a government which is based on the
            consent of the governed. It is a system in which free public opinion
            is the main source of law and in which the government depends upon
            public opinion and responds to changes in public opinion. Democracy
            derives its vitality from the freedom of opinion and discussion that
            it tolerates. In a democracy, it is believed that truth emerges from
            the competition of ideas. We at RUIAMUNâ€™22 will ensure that our
            efforts will help the future generation bring out this motto into
            reality. Even though it is going to be a virtual conference we will
            make sure to make it as interesting and engaging as possible. With
            our wide array of agendas and diverse members of Executive Boards,
            we can assure you that this conference will make you wonder as if it
            is offline!

            <blockquote>
              Dear Future delegates, <br />
              On behalf of Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College and the Ruia
              Student Council, we cordially invite you to the inaugural event of
              team Ruia republic, RUIAMUN'22. With the theme "Preservation of
              democracy, equality and civil liberty", we at the Ruia Republic
              believe that students hold power to change the world for better or
              for worse. It is to enable students with this power that we extend
              to you, RUIA MUN'22. The world thrives on democracy, the essence
              of civilization; democracy thrives on civil liberty and equality.
              It is this dogma that has brought to humankind its most
              significant thinkers and leaders. This conference can be your
              first step to joining the list. This conference is a chance for
              you to exhibit your oratorical, negotiatory, and critical thinking
              skills in a competitive academic simulation of the world's
              peacekeeper, the 'UN'. This lively conference integrates a wide
              range of international concerns and current events that establish
              the status quo and identify crucial areas for change. One must
              first understand each agenda's values and guiding principles to
              change policy and assess the workings of global politics.
              Everyone, regardless of age, must participate in developing public
              policies that affect the lives of millions of people. We've seen
              massive death tolls by a fatal virus, fundamental liberties being
              snatched away by an extremist militant state, and persecution of
              our people by authoritarian regimes. A choice to change this
              affair is imperative, a choice of discussion, conversation, and
              mutual understanding: diplomacy. Diplomacy has been the answer to
              all crises, from hostage situations to vaccine shortages.
              Therefore, we encourage all participating delegates to engage in
              vigorous debate and deliberation, which is critical for a sound
              policy. However, We also urge them not to aggravate or provoke
              and, most importantly, to be open to listening, to uphold and
              solidify the virtue of tolerance in their actions. We look forward
              to your participation and the heated debates with it! Wishing you
              a purposeful time!
